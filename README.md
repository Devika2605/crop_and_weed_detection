# 🌱 Crop and Weed Detection using YOLOv5

An AI-powered object detection project to identify crops and weeds using custom YOLOv5 training — with the goal of precision spraying only on weeds, reducing pesticide use and crop contamination.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

🌾 **Problem Statement:**  
Weeds compete with crops for nutrients, water, and sunlight — reducing yield. Farmers often spray pesticides indiscriminately, harming both weeds and crops.

🎯 **Objective:**  
Build a YOLOv5-based system that detects **crops** and **weeds**, and simulates pesticide spraying **only on weeds** — increasing efficiency and safety.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- YOLOv5 (Object Detection)
- Google Colab (Training & Visualization)
- Python (OpenCV, Matplotlib, Pandas)
- Keras (for Data Augmentation)
- Manual Annotation (YOLO format)

---

## 📂 Dataset

- 📸 ~1300 labeled images (original + augmented)
- 🏷️ YOLO-format bounding box annotations
- 🌾 Class `0` = Crop
- 🌿 Class `1` = Weed

> Dataset was collected manually and augmented using Keras' `ImageDataGenerator`.

## 🛠️ Pipeline

1. **Image Collection & Cleaning**
2. **Image Resizing (4000×3000 ➝ 512×512)**
3. **Data Augmentation (to expand dataset)**
4. **Manual Labeling (YOLO format)**
5. **Model Training with YOLOv5**
6. **Inference and Spray Simulation**
7. **Visualization & Reporting**
